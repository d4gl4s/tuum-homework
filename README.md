## How to build and run application?


To build and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.

3. Run the following command to build the project using Gradle, skipping tests:
   
```code
./gradlew build --exclude-task test
```

4. After the build is successful, run the following command to start the application along with the PostgreSQL database and RabbitMQ using Docker Compose:
   
```
docker-compose up --build
```

5. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:8080` or the RabbitMQ console at `http://localhost:15672` using `username=admin`  and `password=admin` .

6. To stop the application, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running, and then run:

```
docker-compose down
```

## Important Choices in My Solution

Here are some of the choices I made on my own command:

1. **Using BigDecimal:** I decided to use BigDecimal for amounts, since it is more precise than *double*.
2. **Not Using a Mapper:** Currently I am simply converting each response and request object by hand manually. This could be made better by using a mapper that does it for you. I decided to not implement it, since I was running short on time
3. **Not Creating a DTO for getTransactions:** I decided not to create a request object for the getTransactions() endpoint, since we are returning all the fields of the model anyway. This is not best practice and could be improved in the future, to allow for selection of returned fields (if we do not wish to return the ID for example).
4. **SQL Script to Create Database Tables:** I decided to use a good-old sql script to populate the database with tables. This could in theory be done with the combination of MyBatis and Hibernate, but I did not want to use hibernate in this homework.
5. **Using Enums:** I decided to use enums wherever possible, to make the code more maintainable moving forward.
6. **Dockerization:** I would have hoped to include the build process of the springboot application in the Dockerfile, but time was running short and I decided that building the .jar file manually before running containers, is good enough.
7. **Global Exception Handling:** I implemented global exception handling with custom exceptions that match our domain. This makes our endpoints more concise and easier to implement, since we do not have to catch the same exceptions in different endpoints and return appropriate responses. These custom exceptions are thrown in the service classes with meaningful messages, wherever necessary.
8. I split the business logic into two services, because that seemed more reasonable. Additionally, I made sure to only call corresponding mappers methods from services (for example avoided calling accountMapper methods from transactionService)
9. **No Tests:** Since I had an exam on friday, and other schoolwork on saturday, I only had one sunday to complete this assignment. I knew I was not going to finish it, but I decided to give it a shot. I decided that if I ran out of time, I would not implement the tests, since that would be of the least value towards assessing a candidates skills (not sure if that is true or not). I worked on this homework for about 12 hours, running into issues with docker images in the meantime.

## Estimating Transactions per Second

I will try to estimate how many transactions can my application handle on per second on my local development machine.

Since I did not have time to implement tests, I can not run performance test on the application. I will try to estimate the throughput using the request times as guides.

On average each different type of request took (calculated over 10 requests):

* CREATE account: 12 ms
* CREATE transaction: 9 ms
* GET account: 3 ms
* GET transaction: 3 ms

Based on those numbers, an average request takes **6.75 ms**

Lets say that ` TPS = 1 second / average request time`

In that case our estimated transactions per second (TPS) would be `1000 ms / 6.75 ms = 153 requests`

## Scaling Applications Horizontally

To scale the application horizontally, I would consider the following:

* **Microservices:** Splitting the application into microservices means that these services can scale independently. This helps us save resources.
* **Load balancing:** Distributing incoming requests across multiple instances of the application. 
* **Database sharding:** Partitioning data across multiple database instances to distribute the load. 
* **Message Queues:** Using RabbitMQ allows for decoupling of components, making it easier to scale independently.
* **Caching:** Implementing caching to reduce server load.

Other thing to keep in mind:

* **Complexity:** Distributed systems are more difficult to deploy, monitor and troubleshoot.
* **Cost:** Scaling typically leads to increased infrastructure costs. So its important to only scale if really needed.
* **State Management:** If I would like to have shared state between my instances, that is now more difficult.

I guess scaling really depends on the situation. Applications should scale only if needed and not too soon.

## Summary. No tests üôÅ?

Since I had an exam on Friday, and other schoolwork on Saturday, I only had one Sunday to complete this assignment. I knew I was not going to finish it, but I decided to give it a shot. I decided that if I ran out of time, I would not implement the tests, since that would be of the least value towards assessing a candidates skills (not sure if that is true or not, just a thought). I worked on this homework for about 12 hours, running into issues with docker images in the meantime.
